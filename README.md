# Simple App Integrated with Youtube Data API

This project uses the official [Youtube Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com?authuser=1&project=youtube-data-app-421907&supportedpurview=project).

The app is made in React and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Getting Started

* First, clone this repository to your local machine.
* Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies.
* Add an `.env` file inside root directory and add `REACT_APP_YOUTUBE_API_KEY=<your key goes here>`
    * You can get your Youtube Data API key by following the [official documentation](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library/youtube.googleapis.com?authuser=1&project=youtube-data-app-421907&supportedpurview=project).
    * **[NOTE]** This .env file is important as you won't be able to access the app without it.
* Run `npm start` to start the client.
* Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the app.
